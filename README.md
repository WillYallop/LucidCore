# CMS CORE
> Still In Development

CMS Core is a dependency of WillPress (WIP name...), that controls the core functionality of the CMS. It does everything from handling statically generating the site, to validation and optimising media. 

This CMS Core is tightly coupled to the CMS, and does not contain features such as the: API, the CMS site itself and more. It has been created as a seperate repository to make the WillPress CMS easier to maintain and update.
